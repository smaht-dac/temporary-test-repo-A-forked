Testing submitr
===============

This document describes various ways to test this repository.

**NOTE WELL: This documentation is under construction and still refers to SubmitCGAP. It should not yet be trusted.**


Unit Testing
============

The repository has unit testing. To invoke it, do::

   $ make test

This is just syntactic sugar for::

   $ pytest -vv

Suggested Interactive Tests
===========================

There are various commands in ``submitr/scripts``
that you might want to execute at a
command shell. You may need to make small adjustments
to these examples to make them work for you.

As an example, some of these tests are offered with a
``-s http://localhost:8000`` argument (where ``-s`` is shorthand
for ``--server``) to talk to the localhost, since the default is to talk to the
production server. You might need to rewrite to use a different
server, or else to specify an example,
as in ``-e staging``.

Testing the Validate-Only Feature
---------------------------------

Use the ``-v`` or ``-validate-only`` option to validate but not submit a posting::

   $ submit-metadata-bundle submitr/tests/data/submission_test.xlsx -v -s http://localhost:8000

There is also a test file that contains errors so that you can see what errors would look like::

   $ submit-metadata-bundle submitr/tests/data/submission_test_with_errors.xlsx -v -s http://localhost:8000

In either case, you will be queried about whether to do the operation::

   $ submit-metadata-bundle submitr/tests/data/submission_test.xlsx -v -s http://localhost:8000
   Submit submitr/tests/data/submission_test.xlsx to http://localhost:8000 (for validation only)? [yes/no]: no
   Aborting submission.

Only if you answer yes will it proceed, though it will still require that you have credentials set up correctly::

   $ submit-metadata-bundle submitr/tests/data/submission_test.xlsx -v -s http://localhost:8000
   Submit submitr/tests/data/submission_test.xlsx to http://localhost:8000 (for validation only)? [yes/no]: yes
   CGAPPermissionError: Your credentials were rejected by http://localhost:8000. Either this is not the right server, or you need to obtain up-to-date access keys.

Getting correct credentials is a matter of having your ``~/.cgap-keys.json`` file
in good order. See `Setting Up Credentials <INSTALLATION.rst#Setting Up Credentials>`__.
If credentials are set up properly, you can do::

   $ submit-metadata-bundle submitr/tests/data/submission_test.xlsx -v -s http://localhost:8000
   Submit submitr/tests/data/submission_test.xlsx to http://localhost:8000 (for validation only)? [yes/no]: yes

Note that you have some queries you'll have to answer in the middle of this.

Testing resume-uploads
----------------------

If for some reason you had answered no to "Upload 4 files?" you could
resume this operation later by using the GUID that was mentioned toward
the beginning of the output where it says::

   01:27:54 Bundle uploaded, assigned uuid c5bdbeee-49f1-4fa7-9e64-bc93f2cb151f for tracking. Awaiting processing...

This guid is the tracking ID for this submission. You can do::

   $ resume-uploads c5bdbeee-49f1-4fa7-9e64-bc93f2cb151f --bundle_filename submitr/tests/data/submission_test.xlsx -s http://localhost:8000

Testing show-upload-info
------------------------

If you answer no to the post queries, you'll need to come back to that later and try
again.  To do that, you'll need to either use ``resume-uploads`` (as described above)
or else use ``upload-item-data`` to upload individual files. However, to do that you
will need the guid associated with each file.

That information was in the original successful submission, as here:

   {'uuid': '7f09e053-0cee-42ac-aa47-f725adb183d5', 'filename': 'f1_R1.fastq.gz'}
   {'uuid': '776f1767-cb43-48d1-84dc-90955ce0930a', 'filename': 'f1_R2.fastq.gz'}
   {'uuid': '7c039d90-4072-419b-ae12-7031ea9d4274', 'filename': 'f2_R1.fastq.gz'}
   {'uuid': '4afcf1c7-ebfe-4e96-b272-69f358e43ca0', 'filename': 'f2_R2.fastq.gz'}

But you can also recover it if you have the tracking guid, for example::

   $ show-upload-info c5bdbeee-49f1-4fa7-9e64-bc93f2cb151f -s http://localhost:8000
   ----- Upload Info -----
   {'uuid': '7f09e053-0cee-42ac-aa47-f725adb183d5', 'filename': 'f1_R1.fastq.gz'}
   {'uuid': '776f1767-cb43-48d1-84dc-90955ce0930a', 'filename': 'f1_R2.fastq.gz'}
   {'uuid': '7c039d90-4072-419b-ae12-7031ea9d4274', 'filename': 'f2_R1.fastq.gz'}
   {'uuid': '4afcf1c7-ebfe-4e96-b272-69f358e43ca0', 'filename': 'f2_R2.fastq.gz'}

You could also obtain the information from the ``['additional_data']['upload_info']`` part of::

   http://localhost:8000/ingestion-submissions/c5bdbeee-49f1-4fa7-9e64-bc93f2cb151f/?format=json

If you later resubmit the same metadata bundle, it will try to patch, not post::

   $ submit-metadata-bundle submitr/tests/data/submission_test.xlsx -s http://localhost:8000
   Submit submitr/tests/data/submission_test.xlsx to http://localhost:8000? [yes/no]: yes

Test Files
----------

Note that these commands make use of
various test files in ``submitr/tests/data``.

You can create your own test ``.fastq`` files
by using the ``make-sample-fastq-file`` command.

Getting Help
------------

These scripts should respond to a ``--help`` argument so that
you can learn about their purpose and argument syntax.
